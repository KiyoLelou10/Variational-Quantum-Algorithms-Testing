# Variational-Quantum-Algorithms-Testing
This repository contains example code files used to test various variational quantum algorithm ansätze.

This repository contains several of the code bases I used in my experiments, including:
– an implementation of the Quantum Autoencoder proposed by Asaoka et al., trained with gradient descent,
– extended ansätze with mid-circuit measurements and “entanglement forwarding”,
– scripts for studying expressivity via (Q)FIM, Haar-random states, and entanglement entropy,
– simulations of realistic quantum noise for the VQA, and
– experiments comparing different objective functions for training the VQA.
More details can be found in my thesis “Investigation of Variational Quantum Algorithms in Machine Learning via Simulation”.
